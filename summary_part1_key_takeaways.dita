    <ul>
      <li>Structured authoring addresses major business problems like inconsistency, high maintenance overhead, translation costs, and multi-channel publishing challenges by separating content from formatting and enforcing rules.</li>
      <li>DITA is a powerful, topic-based XML standard designed for creating modular, reusable content.</li>
      <li>Key DITA benefits include efficient content reuse, compartmentalization, scalable information architecture, conditional publishing, improved translation efficiency, and automated multi-channel publishing.</li>
      <li>DITA offers significant advantages over other XML-based standards and lightweight markup, particularly for organizations with complex, evolving content needs requiring maximum flexibility and enterprise-grade capabilities.</li>
