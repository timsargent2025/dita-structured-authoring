      <title>DITA vs. DocBook</title>
      <ul>
        <li><b>DocBook Strengths:</b> A mature XML standard with extensive tooling, excellent for book-oriented publications, and strong adoption in academic and technical book publishing.</li>
        <li><b>DITA Advantages:</b> It offers a topic-based approach better suited for modular, reusable content. It has built-in content relationship management via maps and a more flexible specialization mechanism. DITA provides superior support for conditional publishing.</li>
        <li><b>When to Choose DITA:</b> Select DITA when you need maximum content reuse, have multiple publication targets, or require frequent content updates across many documents.</li>
      </ul>

      <title>DITA vs. Custom XML</title>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Custom XML Advantages:</b> Provides complete control over schema design and can be optimized for very specific use cases.</li>
        <li><b>DITA Advantages:</b> It's a proven standard with established best practices and an extensive ecosystem of tools and consultants. There's no need to develop publishing infrastructure from scratch, and it offers an industry-standard skill set for hiring.</li>
        <li><b>Best Practice:</b> Unless you have extremely unique requirements, it's best to leverage DITA's proven framework rather than developing custom XML schemas.</li>
      </ul>

      <title>DITA vs. Markdown/Lightweight Markup</title>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Markdown Strengths:</b> Simple syntax, easy adoption, excellent developer tool integration, and a low barrier to entry.</li>
        <li><b>DITA Advantages:</b> Provides rich semantic markup for complex technical content. It offers sophisticated metadata and relationship management, enterprise-grade content reuse capabilities, and professional publishing quality.</li>
        <li><b>Implementation Strategy:</b> Consider DITA when your content complexity exceeds what simple markup can effectively manage, typically when you need advanced reuse, conditional publishing, or professional-grade multi-format output.</li>
