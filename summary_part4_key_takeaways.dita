    <ul>
      <li>Short descriptions (&lt;shortdesc&gt;) are essential for quick context and improved usability. They serve multiple functions as topic previews, navigation aids, link previews, metadata, and SEO descriptions.</li>
      <li>They appear in UI previews, search results, and help navigation, often being the first content a user sees.</li>
      <li>Every DITA topic should include a short description for clarity and accessibility.</li>
      <li>Structure varies by topic type but always includes purpose, context, and scope indicators appropriate to user intent.</li>
      <li>Optimal length is 25-50 wordsâ€”long enough for context, short enough for quick scanning.</li>
      <li>Clear, reader-focused descriptions that are active, specific, and avoid repeating the title reduce bounce rates and improve discoverability.</li>
    </ul>
