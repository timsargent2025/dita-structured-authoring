    <ul>
      <li><b>Consistency:</b> Writers adhere to a standardized structure, which reduces ambiguity and ensures a uniform information architecture across all content.</li>
      <li><b>Efficiency:</b> It facilitates easier content reuse and automation of publishing workflows, reducing authoring time.</li>
      <li><b>Scalability:</b> Structured authoring supports large documentation sets with multiple contributors.</li>
      <li><b>Multi-channel Publishing:</b> Content can be written once and published to many formats automatically, decoupling the content from its presentation.</li>
      <li><b>Improved Translation Efficiency:</b> Structured content streamlines localization workflows, often leading to a 20-40% reduction in translation costs.</li>
      <li><b>Enhanced Content Findability:</b> Consistent structure and metadata improve content searchability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, a product team releasing monthly software updates can update a single topic (e.g., a new feature) using structured authoring. This topic can then be automatically reused across release notes, help centers, and training documents, eliminating manual copy-paste errors.</p>
