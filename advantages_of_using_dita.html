    <ol class="ol">
      <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Compartmentalization:</strong> DITA encourages authors to create content as small, self-contained topics, each addressing a single subject. This makes content easier to manage, update, and understand.</li>
      <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Content Reuse and Single-Sourcing:</strong> Topics can be reused in multiple documents or outputs without duplication. This means you write once, reuse everywhere. For example, a "reset password" task topic can appear in both user guides and support portals. This dramatically reduces maintenance time from hours to minutes when procedures change, as updates are made in a single place.</li>
      <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Efficient Restructuring:</strong> Because content is modular, it's easy to reorganize topics into new documentation sets using DITA maps, eliminating the need to rewrite or reformat content.</li>
      <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Scalable Information Architecture:</strong> Standardized topic types enforce consistent structure across all content, allowing new team members to quickly understand and contribute to existing content.</li>
      <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Conditional Publishing:</strong> DITA allows the use of filtering attributes to publish tailored content from a single source. For example, a software company can publish "Basic" and "Professional" user guides from the same DITA source, filtering advanced features based on product edition metadata.</li>
      <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Translation Efficiency:</strong> DITA's modular and structured format is ideal for translation and localization. Each topic can be translated independently, reducing duplication and speeding up the workflow. Reused content only needs to be translated once, leading to significant cost savings (typically 20-40%).</li>
      <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Multi-channel Publishing:</strong> DITA is designed for this, meaning you create content once and publish it to many formats (HTML, PDF, ePub, etc.) without rewriting or reformatting.</li>
