    <p>Content reuse is arguably DITA's most compelling business feature, enabling organizations to write once and publish everywhere while maintaining consistency across all publications. This capability directly addresses one of the most expensive and error-prone aspects of large-scale documentation: maintaining duplicate content across multiple documents.</p>

    <section>
      <title>The Duplicate Content Problem and Its Costs</title>
      <p>Large organizations often maintain hundreds or thousands of documents with significant content overlap. Without reuse strategies, a single procedural change might require manual updates across dozens of documents, creating "maintenance nightmares".</p>
      <p>For instance, a telecommunications company with 200+ device installation guides found that 80% of steps were identical across devices. Before DITA, updating safety procedures could take weeks across 160+ documents; with DITA reuse, the same update takes minutes and ensures perfect consistency.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Maintenance Overhead:</b> Writers spend a significant portion of their time (40-60%) updating existing content. Each duplicated procedure multiplies maintenance effort and introduces human errors.</li>
        <li><b>Consistency Failures:</b> Inconsistent information across documents can confuse users, reduce trust, and introduce compliance risks.</li>
        <li><b>Translation Inefficiency:</b> Duplicate content leads to redundant translations, increasing costs and inconsistencies.</li>
        <li><b>Quality Degradation:</b> Copy-pasting often leads to unnoticed changes, resulting in gaps and uneven content quality.</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <title>Strategic Benefits of Content Reuse</title>
      <p>Effective DITA reuse strategies typically lead to 30-60% reduction in content maintenance time and virtually eliminate consistency errors across publications.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Operational Efficiency:</b> Enables single-point maintenance and reduces authoring time through reuse.</li>
        <li><b>Quality Improvement:</b> Centralized updates improve content quality across all reused instances.</li>
        <li><b>Scalability:</b> Supports growing content libraries without proportional maintenance effort.</li>
        <li><b>Risk Reduction:</b> Eliminates variation in safety/compliance information, improving trust and legal compliance.</li>
      </ul>
