      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Custom XML Advantages:</strong> Provides complete control over schema design and can be optimized for very specific use cases.</li>
        <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">DITA Advantages:</strong> It's a proven standard with established best practices and an extensive ecosystem of tools and consultants. There's no need to develop publishing infrastructure from scratch, and it offers an industry-standard skill set for hiring.</li>
        <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Best Practice:</strong> Unless you have extremely unique requirements, it's best to leverage DITA's proven framework rather than developing custom XML schemas.</li>
